# MassEmailSender-Python-

This is a python project I made in a day to solve some of my college hassle of sending multiple emails.
I keep making changes here and there to make it better.

- How To Use?

Usage is simple, for now you need to go to the code and update the list of email addresses that are recipients. 
The message body and subject should be updated in the text files 'Body.txt' and 'Subject.txt'.
I am yet to automate the whole process.
